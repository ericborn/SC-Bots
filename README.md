# SC-Bots
This project was the working directory while I developed my Binary Bot, found here: https://github.com/ericborn/binarybot. 
The goal of the project was to create a bot that was capable of fully autonomous play of the game StarCraft 2. During the project I learned about utilizing Numpy for saving and loading data, constructing Neural nets with TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing both local and cloud GPU's, analyzing data in real-time and working with Linux.
